# nopaper

The goal of this project is to provide a Open REST API for document sorting/searching/OCR'ing/storage and exporting in taxonomies of user choice!

It will also implement a reference implementation for 3rd party apps like Owncloud etc... to integrate into.

## Why?

Rediculous paper management industry, moving towards a more platform independent way of managing your paper documents digitally.
